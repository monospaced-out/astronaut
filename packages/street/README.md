# Street

>The public peace - the sidewalk and street peace of cities - is not kept by primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate almost unconscious network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves and enforced by the people themselves.

Jane Jacobs, *The Death and Life of Great American Cities*

Street is a library that implements a fully decentralized/distributed peer-to-peer reputation system that is resistant to [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). It is built on [p2p-trust](../p2p-trust) and the [jacobs metric](../jacobs-metric). The name is inspired by Jane Jacobs, as the above quote demonstrates. The street is a public place where people (who are otherwise strangers) interact and develop a network of trust and reputation. This library attempts to facilitate the digital equivalent of this reputation - A.K.A. "street cred".
