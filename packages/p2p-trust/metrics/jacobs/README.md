# p2p-trust: jacobs algorithm

>The trust of a city street is formed over time from many, many little public sidewalk contacts... Most of it is ostensibly utterly trivial but the sum is not trivial at all. The sum of such casual, public contact at a local level... is a feeling for the public identity of people, a web of public respect and trust.

Jane Jacobs, *The Death and Life of Great American Cities*
